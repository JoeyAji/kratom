<p class="abouttext1">Noble Kratom is a USA based Kratom distributor that brings only the highest quality Kratom available from its suppliers in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. We work diligently with the best farmers overseas to bring the highest quality and widest assort of Kratom possible and ensure that quality by lab testing it overseas and again in the states once it arrives.</p>
<p class="abouttext">
We came up with the name Noble because we believe Kratom has the potential to aid researchers to the many benefits that this plant may help with the opioid epidemic in our country and that this research is Noble in helping better understand the potential benefits it may have.</p>
<p class="abouttext">
All of the farmers we work with take extra precautions to ensure that the Kratom they harvest is of the highest highest quality by taking all of the leaves and washing them to remove dirt and other natural debris. They are then placed on a drying rack away from the sun to avoid discoloration and loss of alkaloid content. All leaves are placed 1 by 1 instead of lazily stacked to prevent mildew from forming. 
</p><p class="abouttext">
We hope you put your trust in Noble Kratom for your Kratom research with our high quality lab tested Kratom, wide assortment of strains, and excellent customer service!
